 * Operation in an enhanced, customized configuration is at your own risk and requires a
 * comprehensive test phase by the user of the plugin.
 *
 * Customers use the plugins at their own risk. Wirecard CEE does not guarantee their full
 * functionality neither does Wirecard CEE assume liability for any disadvantages related to
 * the use of the plugins. Additionally, Wirecard CEE does not guarantee the full functionality
